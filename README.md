Recommendation

Increase stock for Wheel Weights and Spark Plugs:
Since these parts have the highest usage, maintaining a higher stock level will reduce the risk of stockouts and potential lost sales or service delays.

Monitor usage for CV Axle, Shop Materials, and Brake Pads: 
While the current stock levels seem sufficient based on the analysis, it's crucial to monitor their usage patterns over a more extended period. If usage increases, consider adjusting stock levels accordingly.

Implement a reorder point system:
Determine a specific inventory level for each part that triggers a reorder. This helps maintain optimal stock levels and prevents overstocking or stockouts.

Consider lead times: 
Factor in the time it takes to replenish stock when determining reorder points.

Analyze cost implications: Evaluate the costs associated with holding excess inventory versus the costs of stockouts.

Additional Considerations

● Employee performance: Analyze technician productivity and identify areas for improvement through training or incentives.

● Pricing strategy: Review pricing for services and parts to ensure profitability and competitiveness.

● Financial analysis: Monitor key financial metrics (e.g., revenue, expenses, profit margins) to track business performance.

● Customer satisfaction: Implement customer satisfaction surveys to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.

By implementing these recommendations, it can optimize operations, increase revenue, improve
customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business performance.
